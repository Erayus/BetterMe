# BetterMe

### Problems:
The app addresses the problem where recruiters often have limited time and resources to understand fully an applicant. What the recruiters hear in the interview or see on a resume, a LinkedIn profile is subjective and could be biased or made up. This leads to the risk of their companies missing out hidden talents or hiring people who're not suitable for the company's culture/vision. 

### Solutions: 
The app will allow the students to build a profile based on anonymous feedback given by teammates in group assignments, hackathons, volunteer events or by their teachers or by their managers at their part-time jobs. 
Then, the student can choose to share their profile with the recruiters to demonstrate who they are in other people's eyes. No more hard works that will be unrecognized. Moreover, students will also get a better understanding of themselves.
